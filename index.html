            Tempest's Embrace<br/><br/>
            <i>Should I ask? Wait, what if they hear me?</i><br/><br/>
			I didn't knowâ€¦How could I have known? No wonder I was treated differently, and that everyone looked at me weird whenever I mentioned it. I only wish that I'd kept my mouth shut. Perhaps then I wouldn't be in this situation. The only thing I can do now is pave my own way. I would always sit in the corner of my cell staring at the bed, and every night I would hear the screams of all the innocents souls becoming corrupted. I used to cry like that, have that vague hope that someone would come to our aid and tell us everything would be alright. At one point I wanted nothing more than to wake up from this horrid arrangement of hallucinations that only serve to enslave the common folk. When I realized that, I had started to lose hope, ditch my dreams, and to make it all worse I lost emotion. That's what got me to where I am now, in a windowless concrete room on a bed that has since long lost its' purpose with no blanket. I'm what they call a variant, at least that's what I hear in passing. I asked about it the very first time I heard it and was promptly punished. A sigh leaves my mouth as I play with my new sizeable bruise on my abdomen. I would welcome it to the already existing group, but I had stopped using my voice ever since I discovered I was different.

            Psh, I'm horrible with descriptions. I can't describe the story without spilling the beans, lol.<br/>
			Life ain't worth living without the challenges.
			I'm going to update when I can. As of now I have no clue as to where I am going to go with the story.

            Takashi (Mori) X Reader<br/><br/>
            (y/n) is nothing more than an empty shell. She was always 'different'. Since a young age she was able to hear people's thoughts and her hair and eyes changed color based off of er emotions. She lost her mother in a car accident and her brother was killed by none other than her father. He was going to kill her best friend and reacted. "DON'T TOUCH HARU-CHAN!"<br/><br/>
			Since then she has been living on the streets and being assaulted left and right. There is only one person she shows emotion to. Tired of people trying to those she cares for she trained and developed. Now with strength an skill that surpasses Mitsukuni, what will she do? What happens when her best friend comes back into her life and meets the hoist club?  Will she feel the love that she as long since forgotten?<br/><br/>
			~This is my first fanfiction. I know my writing skills need help (a lot of it) but don't hold back with the comments. I wanna know what you guys think and maybe want to happen in the story. I may throw some a/n in there to explain why I don't update often or to get things off of my chest.~<br/><br/>
			This story has slow updates.<br/>
			Disclaimer: I DO NOT own or take credit of the anime or its characters. That also goes for any media that is used in the chapters.

            The Lost But Never Found<br/><br/>
            Rated M just to be on the safe side.<br/><br/>
			'Loneliness is to be without, and to be without is loneliness. No one truly understands a person. They are not them, so they will never understand. Words are only words without proof or action. Belief is trust in the unknown or uncertain. Trust is meaningless. Worthless. Trust is nothing but a lie.'<br/><br/>
			Ravyn, a rather smart and delicate child has grown up to be empty. To have no one to run to and care for her since a young age. At the age of four her parents tried to kill her she ran off into the forest. Living with the animals and nature. Learning their ways. Two years after she entered that forest she was found. Armed men tried to take her, but she didn't go without putting up a fight. The king of the land has taken interest in her and makes her a bodyguard for both him and his heir: Luka.<br/><br/>
			'To be human is to be confused. They are born into this world confuse and lost. Unsure of their role in this game. What is life? What is death? What does it mean to live?
			The lost could not be found, because the ones here are always lost.'<br/><br/>
			Ten years have passed and now a well trained assassin/bodyguard, Ravyn is tormented by the king and Luka for their own entertainment. What will become of the two, should anything happen that may change their lives? Will a romance bloom or will Ravyn continue to be empty?
